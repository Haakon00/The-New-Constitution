			This document aims to establish a Federation of States, built upon the principles of
			decentralization, separation of powers and limited government. This document shall be the
			supreme law of the Federation. Any law inconsistent with this document shall be void.
		</p>
		<h2 class="text-3xl border-b-2 mt-5 border-black">Article I: Legislative Branch</h2>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl">Section 1</h3>
		<p>
			All federal legislative powers herein granted shall be divided between two separate
			legislative bodies. Powers not herein explicitly granted shall not be exercised. One
			legislative body shall herein be called the Revenue Congress, while the other legislative body
			shall herein be called the Expenditure Congress. Each Congress shall consist of two separate
			chambers called a Senate and a House.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl">Section 2</h3>
		<p>
			A House shall be composed of at least 200 Representatives elected through a nationwide popular
			vote which achieves proportional representation of the electorate. Specifically they shall be
			elected through a closed party-list system, where each political party shall get a number of
			seats proportional to their share of the vote. Representatives shall serve four-year terms,
			and accordingly the election of Representatives shall take place every four years. The
			election of Representatives in the Revenue Congress shall be offset by two years compared to
			the election of Representatives in the Expenditure Congress. When vacancies occur, the
			political party holding the vacant seat shall be entitled to appoint a new Representative to
			serve for the remainder of the term. Each Representative shall have one vote in the House.
			<br /><br />
			The terms of Representatives shall begin at noon on the third Monday of January after the election,
			and end at the same time four years later; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.

		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl">Section 3</h3>

			A Senate shall be composed of two Senators from each State. Senators shall be appointed by
			their respective State legislatures. When vacancies occur, the State legislature may appoint a
			new Senator to serve for the remainder of the term. Each Senator shall have one vote in the
			Senate.

			their affirmative vote. For a bill to become law it shall have passed both chambers of the
			appropriate Congress. For a bill to pass a chamber it shall have gotten affirmative votes of
			more than 60% of the whole chamber, including vacant seats. The only exception are bills which
			solely repeal one or more previously passed bills in their entirety, they shall only need 50%
			affirmative votes to pass, and shall only need to pass in one chamber of the appropriate
			Congress to come into effect. Repeal-bills cannot themselves be repealed through this
			mechanism.<br /><br />Each Senate and each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and
			from time to time publish said journal, excepting parts that may in their judgment require
			secrecy. All votes shall be entered on the journal. <br /><br /> Each Senate and each House may
