    <p>
      This document establishes a sovereign Federation of States, built upon the principles of
      decentralization, separation of powers and limited government. This document shall be the
      supreme law of the Federation. Any law inconsistent with this document shall be void.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl border-b-2 mt-5 border-black font-medium">Article I: Federal Structure</h2>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 1</h3>
    <p>
      The States of the Federation shall enjoy broad autonomy. Matters related to issues such as
      education, social welfare, infrastructure, taxes, economic affairs and all other matters not
      addressed by this Constitution, shall be the exclusive domain of the States.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 2</h3>
    <p>
      No State shall prosecute, punish, restrict or otherwise impose a burden on any individual,
      business or other entity for legal conduct outside the State. Nor shall any State ban,
      restrict or impose an extra tax or other burden on the buying and selling of imported goods
      and services, based on how they were produced outside of the State. A State may however
      require the labeling of imported goods and services with the means of production in a neutral
      manner. This clause shall not be construed to mean that evidence from outside the State may
      not be used in court cases, nor that factors outside the State may not be considered when
      assessing the value of properties inside the State for tax purposes.
      <br />
      <br />
      No State shall put in place tariffs or other trade barriers on exports or imports to protect their
      local industry from outside competition, neither from other States nor from foreign nations, except
      what may be absolutely necessary for executing the State's inspection laws. Any exceeding revenue
      shall be destroyed.
      <br />
      <br />
      No State shall discriminate against citizens of other States in favor of its own citizens in regards
      to basic privileges and immunities. Such privileges and immunities include protection by the government;
      the enjoyment of life and liberty; the right of a citizen of one State to pass through, or to reside
      in any other State, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise; to
      claim the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus; to initiate and maintain legal actions in State
      courts; to own, hold, and dispose of property; and to be exempt from higher taxes or impositions
      than those paid by other State citizens.
      <br />
      <br />
      No State shall have a jurisdiction larger than 150000km<sup>2</sup>
      <br />
      <br />
      No State shall enter into any military treaty or alliance, grant privateering licenses, coin money
      or issue currency, emit bills of credit, or pass any law that impairs the obligation of contracts
      entered outside the State.
      <br />
      <br />
      No State shall, without the consent of the Expenditure Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep
      troops, or military equipment in time of peace, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in
      such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 3</h3>
    <p>
      Each State shall recognize the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other
      State. However, this does not mean that a State must enforce another Stateâ€™s judgment or
      statute if it contradicts its own public policy.
      <br /><br />
      A person charged with a crime in any State who flees from justice and is found in another State
      shall, upon request from the executive authority of the State from which they fled, be returned
      to the State with jurisdiction over the crime.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 4</h3>
    <p>
      Physical property shall only be taxable by the State where it is located. Property which is
      difficult to assign to a physical location, such as digital currency, shall only be taxable by
      the State where the owner is resident. Cross-border transactions, such as remote work or
      online purchases, shall only be taxable by one State according to rules set by the Expenditure
      Congress, but there shall not be any special tax on cross-border transactions that would
      institute a tariff, and the rules shall be based on the nature of the transaction, and shall
      not take into consideration the tax rates or financial situation of the different States.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 5</h3>
    <p>
      Every State in this union shall be on an equal footing; and no federal law shall discriminate
      against any State unless it is predicated on a real and substantial difference relevant to the
      power under which the law is enacted.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 6</h3>
    <p>
      The federal government shall guarantee to every State in this union a republican form of
      government, with appropriate checks and balances, and separation of powers, and shall protect
      each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive
      (when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence. Every State shall have
      an independent judiciary, and a separation between the power to spend and the power to raise
      revenue. The federal courts shall have jurisdiction to decide whether a State has denied its
      people a republican form of government.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 7</h3>
    <p>
      New States may by law be admitted into the Federation by the Expenditure Congress, but no new
      State shall be formed within the jurisdiction of an existing State, nor any State be formed by
      the merger of two or more existing States, without the consent of the legislatures of the
      States concerned as well as of the Expenditure Congress. The only exception to this is that
      the Expenditure Congress may, by law, form a new State from the territory of an existing State
      upon petition from citizens of that State, the recognition of such petitions to be regulated
      by the Expenditure Congress.
      <br /><br />
      The Expenditure Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations
      respecting the territory or other property belonging to the Federation; and nothing in this Constitution
      shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the Federation, or of any particular State.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 8</h3>
    <p>
      Upon the identically-worded resolutions of the legislatures of two-thirds of the States, or of
      States with two-thirds of the national population, any federal law or regulation, identified
      with specificity, is thereby rescinded; once rescinded, such a law may be reenacted according
      to the procedures specified in Article II.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 9</h3>
    <p>
      This Constitution, along with the laws of the Federation enacted in accordance with it, and
      all treaties made under the authority of the Federation, shall be the supreme law of the land.
      Judges in every State shall be bound by it, regardless of any conflicting provisions in State
      constitutions or laws. Federal Senators and Representatives, members of State legislatures,
      and all executive and judicial officers at both the federal and State levels shall be bound by
      oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. However, no religious test shall ever be
      required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Federation.

    </h2>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 1</h3>
    <p>
      All federal legislative powers shall be divided between two distinct legislative bodies. One
      shall be known as the Revenue Congress, and the other as the Expenditure Congress. Each
      Congress shall consist of two separate chambers: a Senate and a House.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 2</h3>
    <p>
      The House shall consist of 550 Representatives. Of these, 500 Representatives shall be elected
      through a nationwide popular vote, and ensure proportional representation of the electorate.
      Specifically, they shall be elected via a closed party-list system, where each political party
      receives a number of seats proportional to their share of the vote. There shall be no minimum
      threshold of votes required for a political party to obtain their share of the seats, other
      than the minimum threshold dictated by the number of available seats. Additionally, 50
      Representatives shall be selected through sortition in a lottery where all eligible citizens
      can enter their names.
      <br /><br />
      Representatives shall serve four-year terms, with elections and selections occurring every four
      years. The election and selection of Representatives in the Revenue Congress shall be staggered
      by two years compared to those in the Expenditure Congress. Each Representative shall have one
      vote in the House. The terms of Representatives shall begin at noon on the third Monday of June
      following the election and shall end at the same time four years later. In the event of vacancies
      in elected seats, the political party that originally filled the seat shall be entitled appoint
      a new Representative to serve the remainder of the term. Vacancies in selected seats shall remain
      unfilled until the full four-year term has elapsed.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 3</h3>
    <p>
      The Senate shall consist of two Senators from each State. Senators shall be appointed by their
      respective State governments in accordance with their State constitution. In the event of
      vacancies, the State may appoint a new Senator to serve the remainder of the term. Each
      Senator shall have one vote in the Senate.
      <br /><br />
      The terms of Senators shall begin immediately upon appointment and shall conclude concurrently
      with the terms of the Representatives in the Revenue Congress who were serving at the time of the
      appointment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 4</h3>
    <p>
      Each State legislature shall prescribe the exact times, places and other details of polling
      stations in their respective State for the election of Representatives, but the Electoral
      branch may at any time make or alter such regulations. <br /><br /> No person shall be a federal
      legislator who is not at least 25 years of age. <br />No person shall be a federal legislator
      who has already served three terms as a federal legislator. <br /> No person shall be a federal
      legislator who is also holding a position at the Judicial branch or Electoral Commission.<br
      />No person shall be a federal legislator who has already served or is serving as a federal
      Supreme Court Justice.<br /> No person shall serve as a federal legislator in both the Revenue
      Congress and Expenditure Congress at the same time, nor shall any person hold multiple seats in
      a single Congress. <br />No person shall serve as a federal legislator whilst also serving as
      a legislator, governor, judge or other government official in a State government.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 5</h3>
    <p>
      Each Senate and each House shall have a board of proposed legislation where members can at any
      time add their own proposed bills, as well as their signature to proposed bills to signal
      their affirmative vote. For a bill to become law it shall have passed both chambers of the
      appropriate Congress. For a bill to pass a chamber it shall have gotten affirmative votes of
      more than 60% of the whole chamber, including vacant seats. The only exception are bills which
      solely repeal one or more previously passed bills in their entirety, they shall only need 50%
      affirmative votes to pass, and shall only need to pass in one chamber of the appropriate
      Congress to come into effect. Repeal-bills themselves and bills admitting new States into the
      union cannot be repealed through this mechanism. All changes to the constitution must go
      through the constitutional amendment proceure outlined in article 8. All bills shall cite
      where in the constitution the scope of the legislation is authorized.<br /><br />Affirmative
      votes for bills in the Revenue Congress that raise taxes, borrow on credit, or otherwise tries
      to raise revenue shall implicitly also count as an affirmative vote for bills that tries raise
      revenue by the same mechanism but by a lower amount.<br /><br />Each Senate and each House
      shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish said journal, excepting
      parts that may in their judgment require secrecy. All votes shall be entered on the journal. <br
      /><br /> Each Senate and each House may otherwise determine the rules of its proceedings as long
