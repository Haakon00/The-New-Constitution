		<p>
			This document establishes a sovereign Federation of States, built upon the principles of
			decentralization, separation of powers and limited government. This document shall be the
			supreme law of the Federation. Any law inconsistent with this document shall be void.
		</p>
		<h2 class="text-3xl border-b-2 mt-5 border-black font-medium">Article I: Federal Structure</h2>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 1</h3>
		<p>
			The States of the Federation shall enjoy broad autonomy. Matters related to issues such as
			education, social welfare, infrastructure, economic affairs, health and safety, and all other
			matters not addressed by this Constitution shall be the exclusive domain of State governments.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 2</h3>
		<p>
			No State shall punish, restrict or otherwise impose a burden on any individual, business or
			other entity for legal conduct outside the State, even if connected to activities inside the
			State. All State laws that restrict or put other burdens on people, items or activities must
			be based on properties of those people, items or activities that are reasonably apparent
			inside the State. Laws that purely aim to inform consumers in a non-discriminatory manner and
			prevent fraud shall be exempt from this requirement. This clause shall not be construed to
			mean that evidence from outside the State may not be used in court cases.
			<br />
			<br />
			 No State shall put in place tariffs or other trade barriers on exports and imports to protect
			their local industry from outside competition, both from other States and from foreign
			nations, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing the State's inspection laws.

			of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, whether criminal or civil,
			retroactive taxes, any law impairing the obligation of contracts signed outside the State, or
			grant any title of nobility.
			<br />
			<br />
			 No State shall, without the consent of the Expenditure Congress, lay any duty of tonnage,
			keep troops, or military equipment in time of peace, or engage in war, unless actually
			invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 3</h3>
		<p>
			No State shall discriminate against citizens of other States in favor of its own citizens in
			regards to basic privileges and immunities. Such privileges and immunities include protection
			by the government; the enjoyment of life and liberty; the right of a citizen of one State to
			pass through, or to reside in any other State, for purposes of trade, agriculture,
			professional pursuits, or otherwise; to claim the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus; to
			institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the State; to take, hold and
			dispose of property, either real or personal; and an exemption from higher taxes or
			impositions than are paid by the other citizens of the State.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 4</h3>
		<p>
			Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial
			proceedings of every other State. This shall however not be construed to mean that a State
			must enforce another State's judgement or statute in contradiction to its own public policy.
			<br /><br />

			another State, shall on demand of the executive authority of the State from which they fled,

			government, with appropriate checks and balances, and separation of powers, and shall protect
			each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive
			(when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence. The federal courts shall
			have jurisdiction to decide whether a State has denied its people a republican form of
			government.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 7</h3>
		<p>
			Every State in this Union shall be on an equal footing; and no law shall discriminate against
			any State unless it is predicated on a real and substantial difference relevant to the power
			under which the law is enacted.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 8</h3>
		<p>
			New States may by law be admitted into the Federation by the Expenditure Congress, but no new
			State shall be formed within the jurisdiction of an existing State, nor any State be formed by
			the merger of two or more existing States, without the consent of the legislatures of the
			States concerned as well as of the Expenditure Congress. The only exception to this is that
			the Expenditure Congress may, by law, form a new State from the territory of an existing State
			upon petition from citizens of that State, the recognition of such petitions to be regulated
			by the Expenditure Congress.
			<br /><br />
			 The Expenditure Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and
			regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the Federation; and

			and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the Federation, shall be
			the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing
			in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. The Senators and
			Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several State legislatures, and all
			executive and judicial officers, both of the Federation and of the several States, shall be
			bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever

		<h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-medium">Section 2</h3>
		<p>

			minimum treshold of votes required for a political party to get their share of the seats. In
			addition, 20 Representatives shall be selected by sortition in a lottery where all citizens
			eligible to become a Representative shall be entitled to enter their name. Representatives
			shall serve four-year terms, and accordingly the election and selection of new Representatives
			shall take place every four years. The election and selection of Representatives in the
			Revenue Congress shall be offset by two years compared to the election and selection of
			Representatives in the Expenditure Congress. When vacancies in elected seats occur, the
			political party which filled the seat shall be entitled to appoint a new Representative to
			serve for the remainder of the term. Vacancies in selected seats shall not be filled before
			the full four-year term of the vacated seat has elapsed. Each Representative shall have one
			vote in the House.

			time add their own proposed bills, as well as their signature to proposed bills to signal
			their affirmative vote. For a bill to become law it shall have passed both chambers of the

			more than 60% of the whole chamber, including vacant seats. The only exception are bills which
			solely repeal one or more previously passed bills in their entirety, they shall only need 50%
			affirmative votes to pass, and shall only need to pass in one chamber of the appropriate
			Congress to come into effect. Repeal-bills themselves cannot be repealed through this
			mechanism. All changes to the constitution must go through the constitutional amendment
			proceure outlined in article 8. All bills shall cite where in the constitution the scope of
			the legislation is authorized.<br /><br />Affirmative votes for bills in the Revenue Congress
			that raise taxes, borrow on credit, or otherwise tries to raise revenue shall implicitly also
			count as an affirmative vote for bills that tries raise revenue by the same mechanism but by a
			lower amount.<br /><br />Each Senate and each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings,
			and from time to time publish said journal, excepting parts that may in their judgment require
			secrecy. All votes shall be entered on the journal. <br /><br /> Each Senate and each House
